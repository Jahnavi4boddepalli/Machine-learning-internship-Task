Titanic Survival Classification – Machine Learning Project
This project presents an end-to-end machine learning pipeline developed using the Titanic dataset.
The objective is to build a predictive model that classifies whether a passenger survived based on demographic, socioeconomic, and travel-related attributes.
The project demonstrates proficiency in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model development, evaluation, and interpretation of results using standard machine learning practices.
Project Overview:
The work includes:

Selecting a public dataset (Titanic – Kaggle)
Cleaning and preprocessing the data
Performing exploratory data analysis to identify key patterns
Building multiple classification models
Evaluating model performance using appropriate ML metrics
Conducting error analysis and presenting findings
Providing improvement suggestions and a final summary
This project aligns with the typical workflow expected in real-world machine learning tasks.

Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn
